# heap-queue
An exploration of queues using a heap.


Purpose

    This project is designed to explore queues using heaps.


Input

    4 text files containing ascending sorted, descending sorted, and random integers lists.

Output
    
    4 output files containing records of built heaps, modified heaps after insertion and deletion, and out3.txt contains 
    records of each iteration of 10 insertions and deletions along with the time for each process.

Bugs or Implemented Test Cases

    Follow up testing could include the timing of insertion and deletion on sorted versus random lists.
