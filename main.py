I. Purpose of the program and any information pertaining to its description
This project is designed to explore queues using heaps, particularly
the insert and deleteMin methods.


II. Input
4 text files containing ascending sorted, descending sorted, and random integers lists.

III. Output
4 output files containing records of built heaps, modified heaps after insertion and deletion,
and out3.txt contains records of each iteration of 10 insertions and deletions along with the time
for each process.

IV. Bugs or Implemented Test Cases; and, any theoretical follow-up including assignment questions to be turned in for grading
Follow up testing could include the timing of insertion and deletion on sorted versus random lists.
